# 👑 TN-Epic: The Infinite Quest

### *The World’s First State-Scale Experience Operating System*

**TN-Epic** is not a passive travel app—it is a **Real-World Meta-Game** that transforms the entire geography of Tamil Nadu into a playable AR adventure.  
It leverages **game psychology, AI, and spatial computing** to address state-level economic leakage, civic engagement, and over-tourism.

🔗 **Live Deployment:** _[Prototype](https://tn-epic.lovable.app/)_
